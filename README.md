## Project: Revenue Forecasting with Meta's Prophet

This project demonstrates a practical end-to-end workflow for forecasting revenue using Meta's Prophet, a powerful open-source time series forecasting library. It walks you through each phase of the process, highlighting best practices and illustrating how to transform raw transactional data into reliable revenue projections.

### Key Objectives

- **Data Cleansing**: Handle missing entries, outliers, and inconsistencies to prepare high-quality time series data.
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Visualize trends, seasonality, and anomalies in historical revenue to inform modeling decisions.
- **Feature Engineering**: Derive temporal features (e.g., day of week, month, holidays) and external regressors to improve forecast accuracy.
- **Model Configuration**: Configure and tune Prophet’s parameters—seasonality modes, changepoint detection, growth assumptions—to capture revenue dynamics.
- **Forecast Generation**: Produce short- and long-term revenue forecasts with uncertainty intervals, enabling data-driven planning.
- **Evaluation & Insights**: Assess forecast performance using error metrics and component analysis, and extract actionable insights on revenue drivers.

### Highlights

- Seamless integration of data preprocessing and modeling steps in a single interactive notebook.
- Clear visualizations of trends, seasonality, and forecast components to aid interpretation.
- Modular code structure for easy adaptation to different datasets or forecasting horizons.
- Recommendations on potential enhancements, such as incorporating promotional events or additional external signals.

Whether you are a data scientist new to time series forecasting or an experienced practitioner looking for a structured Prophet tutorial, this project provides a comprehensive guide to building robust revenue forecasts.
